4.  **Simulate Feedback:** You can also enter simulated rejection feedback to trigger the "Critic Reflector Agent" and refine the analysis.

You can see the real-time logs of agent activities in the "Live Thinking Stream" section of the application.

To stop the background Streamlit application, you can use the command `kill <PID>` where `<PID>` is the process ID of the Streamlit application (which was `41060` in the previous run). You can also run `killall streamlit` if you prefer.
