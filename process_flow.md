**Ingestion**: The Profiler parses your resume and GitHub. It doesn't just list skills; it identifies "soft spots" (e.g., "Good at Python, but lacks async experience").

**Market Reasoning**: The Market Strategist looks at live listings for your dream roles. It notices that "FastAPI" is trending over "Flask" for the roles you want.

**Autonomous Planning**: The Roadmap Planner creates a 2-week sprint: "Build a project with FastAPI to bridge the gap."

**Executive Action**: While you learn, the Executive Agent identifies "stretch" internships and drafts tailored cover letters highlighting your current learning sprint.

**Feedback Reflection**: If an application is rejected, the Critic parses the email. If it says "needed more cloud experience," the system immediately updates your Roadmap to include AWS/Azure.
